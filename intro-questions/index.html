<li> Hi I'm Harrison, I'm a junior majoring in econ and psych with a minor in design</li>
<li> I'm taking this class for my design minor and to get some fluency in basic coding which I have no experience in</li>
<li> I have no experience in html or css </li>
<li> I want to leave this class with a basic understanding of how html and css work in order to be able to better communicate between designers and engineers</li>
<li> I expect there to be a greater focus on functionality and usability than I am used to</li>
<li><a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> exemplifies effective design, as it has both functionality and visual appeal, and is deeply customizable to match the users' preferences </li>
<li>I think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>  does an effective job of communication, as it contains tons of information and interactions and does it all in a way that is easy to navigate and makes logical sense</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a></a> works well because it fulfills its' purpose in a way that gives the user exactly what they are looking for, but does so in a way to reduce other distractions </li>
