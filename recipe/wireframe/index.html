In a food processor, combine all of your basil with 3 tablespoons of toasted pine nuts, 4 ounces of parmesan cheese, and a healthy drizzle of olive oil. The resulting spread should be relatively chunky, continue to mix in olive oil or water until the desired consistency is achieved. Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately mixed into pasta, topped with sliced cherry tomatoes and served with a side of fresh meatballs and a side salad.
